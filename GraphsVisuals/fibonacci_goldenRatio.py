# The Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ......) is the series of numbers where ith number in the series is the sum of the two previous numbers
# that is the numbers in the positon ( i -2 ) and (i -1 ). The successive numbers
# in this series display an intresting relationshsip. As you increase the number of terms
# in the series, the ratios of consecutive pairs of numbers are nearly equal to each other 
# This value approaches a special number 1.618033988..., and its been the subject of extensive study
# in music , architecture, and nature. 

# Write a Program that will plot on a graph  the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers for
# say 100 numbers, which will demonstrate that the values approach the golden ratio.

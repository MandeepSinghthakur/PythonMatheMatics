# A function is a mapping between  an input set and the output set . The Special condition of a function
# is that an element of the input set is related to exactly one element of the output set 

# Domain and range of function
 # The Domain of a function is the set of input values that the independent variable can validly assume 
 # The output set of a fucntion is called the range
 # For Example the domain of the function f(x) = 1/x is all nonzero real and complex numbers 
 # because 1/0 isn't defined . The Range is formed by the set of values obtained by substituting 
 # each number in the domain into 1/x, so in this case it is also all nonzero real and complex numbers

 ##The domain and range of a function can certainly be diffrent. Fo example, for the function
 # x^2 , the domain is all +ve and -ve numbers, but the range is only the +ve numbers.


 #Common Mathemtical Functions
  # sin() , cos() trignometric functions.
  # Other Trignometric functions - tan() and the inverse
  # equivalents of these functions asin(), acos() and atan().
import math
print(math.sin(math.pi/2))

#You can do the same with sympy
import sympy
sympy.sin(math.pi/2)
